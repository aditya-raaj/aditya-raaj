# Hi, I'm Aditya Raj

I'm a final-year Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning undergraduate with a strong interest in building reliable software systems that combine backend engineering, data pipelines, and applied machine learning.

I enjoy working on real-world problem statements where models, data, and APIs come together to form practical, production-style systems rather than standalone experiments.

---

## What I focus on
- Backend development using Python and FastAPI  
- Designing clean REST APIs and service layers  
- Data processing and ETL pipelines  
- Integrating machine learning models into real systems  

---

## Featured projects
- **Hybrid Cascade Log Classifier**  
  Rule-based + ML + LLM-based log classification system with modular pipelines and FastAPI backend.

- **LifeLink – Emergency Ambulance Routing System (IISc)**  
  Real-time ambulance dispatch and route optimization using live traffic data and graph algorithms.

- **World Development Indicators Analytics Platform**  
  API-driven ETL pipeline for global indicators with analytics-ready data modeling.

- **OCTVision – Retinal Disease Detection API**  
  Deep learning inference service exposed via REST APIs for medical image analysis.
